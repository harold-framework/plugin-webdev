# Monaco Editor Installation.

As mentioned in the initial README for this project, the Microsoft Monaco editor is used to render the actual editors for the IDE. Since the project is very large and constantly changing, instead of including a static version in the repo which would also inflate the download size alot, you should manually install it.

You can find the project [here](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor). Simply clone the repository here and name the directory `monaco`.
