Droplets are simply html files that are loaded into divs in the main page.
Any code inside of 'droplet.html' are loaded into divs in the 'droplets' div.
The divs are then set with the id of the name of the droplet.

Each droplet should respect the following layout.
A '*' marks required files:

    *droplet.html
    droplet.js
    style.css

The 'droplet.js' and 'style.css' files are loaded after the 'droplet.html' div is loaded.
